# A Python Graph Implementation  
## Graph.py  
* AddVertex pushes a vertex to the graph  
* DeleteVertex removes a vertex from the graph  
* AssignEdgeWeight takes in a start, end, and weight to set the weight of an edge. If the graph is undirected, the opposite direction's edge will also be set  
* DijkstraShortestPaths returns a dictionary of the shortest path weights for each vertex starting at the first vertex  
  
## GraphImplementation.py  
Implements all of the functions from Graph.py. Not necessarily a suite of test cases, but an example file.
